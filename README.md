Hexagonal Grid Library for Lua

This library is written in PURE Lua, which means it can be used with any framework :D

This library implements Axial Coordinate hex grids with the hexagon oriented such that it is "pointy topped".

What is axial coordinates
-------------------------

In axial coordinates, there are two axes x and y. In my implementation of hex grids, hex coordinate x is aligned with the horizontal coordinate, and hex coordinate y is angled 30 degrees from the vertical coordinate.
